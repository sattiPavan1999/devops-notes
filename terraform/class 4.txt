Workspace

* bydefault there is a default workspace
* whenever we created the instance it will be created in the default workspace
* If we want another instance to be created without modifying the resource.tf file (by increasing count) then 
we have to create a new workspace and we have to run terraform apply in this workspace so that another instance will be created



vim provider.tf
(
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

)

vim resource.tf
(
resource "aws_instance" "myserver" {

tags = {
Name = "${terraform.workspace}-server"
Environment = "Dev"
Client = "AT&T"
}

ami = "ami-00ca570c1b6d79f36"

instance_type = "t2.micro"

key_name = "new-mac-key"

root_block_device {
volume_size = 20
}

}
)

(Name will be assigned based on workspace)

   22  terraform workspace show
(current workspace)

   23  terraform workspace list
(terraform workspace list)

   24  terraform workspace new flm-ws
(creates flm-ws workspace and switched to it)

   28  terraform workspace new dev-ws
   29  terraform apply --auto-approve
(instance is created in dev-ws)

   30  terraform workspace select flm-ws
(switched to flm-ws)
   31  terraform apply --auto-approve
(instance is created in flm-ws)

   32  terraform workspace select default
(switched to default)
