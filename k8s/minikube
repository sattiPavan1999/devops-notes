MINIKUBE
(It is a tool used to setup a single node cluster on k8s)

* We need a server with 2 cpus and 4 gb of ram

    1  yum install docker -y && systemctl start docker
        (installing docker is needed)

    (Go to this url to select the installation commandâ€¨https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)
    (we will get below two commands from this link)
    2  curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/latest/download/minikube-linux-amd64
    3  sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube && rm minikube-linux-amd64

    4  minikube version
    (Check minikube is installed or not)

    5  minikube start --driver=docker --force
    (command to start minikube)

    6  minikube status
    (check the status of minikube)

    7  docker ps
    (we can see a minikube container)
    
    8  curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    (This is for installing kubectl. Go to below link to copy the command)
    (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

    9 chmod +x kubectl
      (give x permissions to kubectl)
      (we can see this in the above official link)

    10 kubectl version
       (we get "command not found")
    11 mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
       (so we need to move this to its default path)
    12 kubectl version
       (now we can see version)

 14  kubectl api-resources
	(see the list of resources)

IMPERATIVE WAY

   15  kubectl run mypod --image=nginx
	(To create a pod)
	(We are giving image name)
	(container will be there inside the pod)

   16  kubectl get pods
	(list of pods)

DECLARATIVE WAY
(means we have to create through a manifest file)

   18  vim pod.yml
	(

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-name1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: pod-container1
      image: shaikmustafa/cycle
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80

	)

(NOTE: we will get apiVersion, kind from the running of this command "kubectl api-resources")
(NOTE: file should be in the form for .yml or .yaml format only)
   
   21  kubectl create -f pod.yml
	(To create a pod)

   22  kubectl get pods
	(list of pods)

   23  kubectl get pods -o wide
	(To get the IP address of a pod)

   24 kubectl get pods -o yaml
	(To get all pods information in yaml format)

   25 kubectl get pods pod-name1 -o yaml
	(To get specific pod information)

   26 kubectl get pods pod-name1 -o json
	(To get specific pod information in json format)

   27 kubectl describe pods pod-name1
	(To get full information about a pod)

   28 kubectl delete pod mypod
	(It will delete the specific pod called mypod from pods)

   29  kubectl delete pod --all
	(It will delete all the pods)
